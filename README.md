Code and Data for NMFS Data Analysis Sections of Pearse et al. (2019) –
Nature Ecology and Evolution
================

This repository holds the data and code to render the results provided
by analyses done by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center coauthors on
Pearse et al. (2019) — “Sex-dependent dominance maintains migration
supergene in rainbow trout”

The scripts were written and executed by different authors as follows:

  - 100 series. Steve Lindley, `steve.lindley@noaa.gov`
  - 200 series. Matthew “Mac” Campbell, `drmaccampbell@gmail.com`
  - 300 series. Eric C. Anderson, `eric.anderson@noaa.gov`

The R scripts rely on a variety of packages that are either from CRAN or
Bioconductor, unless noted otherwise in the code (i.e., some are from
GitHub repositories.)

A few large, standard data sources like the WorldClim data set and
Natural Earth Data which were used in analyses are not included here.
Those wishing to reproduce the results will need to acquire those and
modify the scripts to have appropriate path references to those sources.
